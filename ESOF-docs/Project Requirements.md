##**Introdução** <a name ="intro"></a>

Para o desenvolvimento de uma aplicação de sucesso, umas das fases mais importantes é a fase de levantamento de requisitos. Neste etapa, a equipa tem como objetivo conhecer o domínio em que o projeto se enquadra, entender as necessidades dos utilizadores, identificar possíveis problemas e apresentar soluções. Podemos afirmar então que esta fase trata-se de um processo iterativo, com uma contínua validação de uma atividade para a outra. 

Antes de continuar, queremos acrescentar que voltamos a contactar os contribuidores principais do projeto, voltando a não ter resposta da sua parte, portanto o que será dito posteriormente serão suposições.

##**QIS Malaria Case Surveillance** <a name ="malaria"></a>
The **QIS Malaria Case Surveillance** is an open-source mobile application designed to report positive cases of malaria detected throughout Cambodia in near real-time.

This application is intended to be used by healthcare providers in the field after they have conducted an mRDT (Malaria rapid diagnostic tests).

The application is based on the [QoCapplication](https://github.com/EyeSeeTea/malariapp) which allows to issue automatic generated surveys and retrieve and push information to a wide range of platform such as DHIS2 servers.

As of today (15/10/2016), we weren't able to get a reply neither from the main contributors and neither from the official website regarding the development process used in this project. Based on what we read about the different types of development processes and the analysis of the several commits, we think that the most adequate one is **Incremental development and delivery**. 




###**Incremental development and delivery** <a name="idd"></a>
The basic idea behind this process is to develop the system in small portions at a time and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the next.



###**Opinion**<a name="opinion"></a>
Despite the fact that this process has a lof of **advantages**, like generating working software quickly and earlier during its life cycle or being easier to test and debug because relatively smaller changes are made during each iteration, it also has its **downsides**. It needs a good planning and design, all the iterations are very rigid and must not overlap each other and the system structure tends to degrate as new increments are added. If this rules aren't followed problems my arise related to additional functionalities that were not initially planned. This may lead to a cost higher than the stipulated one and a late release date.

However, we believe that this process is the right one to be used for this application development.
